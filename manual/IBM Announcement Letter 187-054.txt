ADAPTER INTERFACE
-----------------

The adapter interface provided with the IBM Display Adapter 8514/A is
a programming interface that makes programming the adapter
significantly easier than programming directly to the hardware.  It
handles much of the complexity of the hardware register interface on
behalf of the programmer and provides a call interface that supports
commonly required display adapter functions in a convenient form.

       A Display Adapter 8514/A Adapter Interface Application
Developer's Tutorial is available and must be ordered separately.
The tutorial is intended to help application developers become
familiar with writing applications for the adapter interface.  It
consists of a user's guide publication and a diskette containing
utilities, demonstration material and anti-aliasing image fonts.

VDI DRIVERS:  Virtual Device Interface (VDI) drivers will be
available to allow applications written to the IBM Personal Computer
Graphics Development Toolkit to run with the IBM Display Adapter and
IBM Display Adapter 8514/A.

       The IBM Display Adapter has VDI drivers to support the IBM
Personal Computer Graphics Development Toolkit, Version 1.20 (IBM
Personal Computer DOS) and IBM Operating System/2 Graphics
Development Toolkit.  The VDI drivers are included with the Graphics
Development Toolkits.  Refer to Programming Announcement 287-106,
dated April 2, 1987, for details.

       For the IBM Display Adapter 8514/A, the drivers are written to
the adapter interface and will support the following modes:
*   640 x 480 -- 256 colors
*   640 x 480 -- 16 colors
*   1024 x 768 -- 256 colors
*   1024 x 768 -- 16 colors

       The drivers will allow VDI applications to take advantage of
the new functions available in the adapter, such as improved
performance, 256 colors and high content.  The IBM Display Adapter
8514/A VDI drivers for the IBM Personal Computer Graphics Development

They are packaged in a correspondence folder that contains the
drivers on a diskette and a booklet with description.  The IBM
Display Adapter 8514/A VDI drivers for the IBM Operating System/2
Graphics Development Toolkit are included in the IBM Operating
System/2 Graphics Development Toolkit.  Refer to Programming
Announcement 287-106, dated April 2, 1987, for additional
information.

COMPATIBILITY:  The IBM Display Adapter emulates the IBM Monochrome
Display and Printer Adapter, the IBM Color/Graphics Monitor Adapter
and the IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter modes and enables applications
written at the BIOS level to be run.  Most applications written to
the hardware of these adapters will also run, but will require
testing due to different hardware register implementation.  The IBM
Display Adapter does not emulate the Professional Graphics
Controller.

       The IBM Display Adapter is functionally equivalent to the
integrated display adapter in the IBM Personal System/2 Models 50, 60
and 80.  Most applications written to the new display modes of the
integral display adapter of these products will also run, but must be
tested to ensure compatibility.  Selected applications that use both
color and monochrome modes, or that use the vertical re-trace
interrupt feature, may require change.

       The IBM Display Adapter 8514/A co-exists with the integrated
display adapter in the IBM Personal System/2 Models 50, 60 and 80.
Applications that run using the integrated display adapter will
continue to run when IBM Display Adapter 8514/A is installed.  In
order to use the advanced function modes of the IBM Display Adapter
8514/A, applications must be written to either the adapter interface
or an application programming interface such as the VDI, that uses
the adapter interface.  Most VDI applications will run on IBM Display
Adapter 8514/A using the IBM Display Adapter 8514/A VDI driver
without change.  Software applications written for the Professional
Graphics Controller that use the IBM Personal Computer Graphics
Development Toolkit will be compatible with the IBM Display Adapter
8514/A.

LIMITATIONS:  The IBM Display Adapter installed in an IBM Personal
Computer, IBM Personal Computer XT, IBM Personal Computer XT Model
286, IBM Personal Computer AT can coexist with a Monochrome
Display/Printer Adapter (MPA) or a Color/Graphics Monitor Adapter
(CGA), but not an Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA).  Concurrent modes
of operation are restricted to:
*   IBM Display Adapter running color modes while MPA is in
    monochrome mode
*   IBM Display Adapter running monochrome modes while CGA is in
    color mode.
       With the IBM Display Adapter installed in an IBM Personal
System/2 Model 30, two displays can be used alternately if supported
by the application program.

       With the IBM Display Adapter 8514/A dual screen
configurations, a second screen may be attached to the integrated
display adapter on the system unit.  The second screen displays the
output of the integrated display adapter.  The primary screen
(attached to the IBM Display Adapter 8514/A) displays either the
output from the integrated display adapter or the advanced function
output of the IBM Display Adapter 8514/A, depending on whether
advanced function mode has been set on the IBM Display Adapter
8514/A.

       The IBM 5151 Monochrome Display, the IBM 5153 Color Display,
the IBM 5154 Enhanced Color Display, and the IBM 5175 Professional
Graphics Display cannot be attached to the IBM Display Adapter or IBM
Display Adapter 8514/A.
